<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The second year of the war opened in the West with the enemy, although
superior in man power and munitionment, pinned down to a defensive line
from Belfort to the sea. The new armies of the British Empire were still
being raised and trained, and neither England nor France had reached
their zenith in the production of guns and munitions. The western front
was to remain for a time comparatively inactive.</p>

<p>In the East the great Teutonic drive through Poland was still in
progress, although the Russian armies had everywhere escaped
envelopment, and their retreat was nearly at an end. Warsaw was occupied
by the Germans early in August. It was a moment chosen by Germany to
make an offer of separate peace to Russia. The enemy sought to gain by
bribery what his armies had failed to accomplish in the field. The offer
was rejected by Russia.</p>

<p>By October Germany&#39;s greatest military effort so far had failed and the
Russian armies stood intact from the Bukovina to Riga.</p>

<p>The next great development in the history of the war was the entry of
Bulgaria in October on the side of the Central Powers. Whilst great
German and Austro-Hungarian forces crossed the Danube in the north the
Bulgarians attacked Serbia on the flank. In a few weeks Serbia and
Montenegro suffered the fate of Belgium and Luxemburg, the British and
French troops not having arrived in time to render material aid to the
Serbians. Greece, failing to live up to her treaty with Serbia,
contributed to the defeat of that country and was for many months to
form a menace to the allied troops who were making the port of Salonika
their base in the Balkans.</p>

<p>In the meantime the western allies had taken the offensive in September,
the French attacking in Champagne and the British in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>

Flanders. The attack was not driven home and no further offensive upon a
large scale was to take place until July in the following year.</p>

<p>January saw Gallipoli evacuated by the Allies, releasing Turkish troops
for service in Mesopotamia which was doubtless to have its effect in the
fall of Kut and the capture of the garrison later on.</p>

<p>Late in February the great German offensive began at Verdun, an
offensive which was to prove the most costly defeat of the German arms
during the war. The Battle of Verdun continued for months and may be
said to have been definitely lost by the Germans by the 1st of July.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russian armies in the Caucasus and Armenia had beaten the
Turks in many engagements, taking amongst other towns the fortress of
Erzerum with great numbers of prisoners and military stores. The other
Russian armies in the north, reorganized and thoroughly equipped with
munitionment, began in June their magnificent advance all along their
line from Riga to the Carpathians.</p>

<p>The last month of the second year of the war witnessed the beginning of
the "big push" in the west, the Russian advance in the east, the retreat
of the Austrians in the Trentino, and the beginning of the Italians&#39;
successful thrust upon the Isonzo.</p>

<p>It is with these major military operations of the year with which
Raemaekers&#39; cartoons on the following pages deal.</p>

<p>He did not neglect to record, however, many of the minor happenings. The
various and devious peace moves of the enemy did not escape his comment
nor did the cold blooded murders of Nurse Cavell and Captain Fryatt. He
has recorded also many examples of German Zeppelin Ruthlessness and
German Piracy on the sea. Notable amongst the latter is the <span class="italic">Sussex</span>
crime and its subsequent diplomatic developments, which were to play
such an important part in America&#39;s entry into the war.</p>

<p>That the Dardanelles and Galicia had been offered by Berlin to
Petrograd; that Egypt was asked for Turkey, and that the mediation of
the Pope was desired on the basis of the restitution of Belgium, were
some of the reports which gained currency between Aug. 5, the date of
the fall of Warsaw, and Aug. 12, when the Novoe Vremya of Petrograd
confirmed the rumors of German overtures for a separate peace with
Russia.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously from Petrograd and from Milan announcements that,
after the capture of Warsaw, Germany was seriously engaged in
preliminary negotiations for the establishment of a peace were
published.</p>

<p>Besides Galicia and the Dardanelles, the Novoe Vremya said, Germany
would guarantee the integrity of the Russian frontiers, at the same time
stipulating for Egypt on the pretext of ceding that country to Turkey,
and for a free hand to deal with Russia&#39;s allies. The report declared
that these offers were rejected by the Czar&#39;s Government.</p>

</h2>

<hr />

<p>On August 5, 1915, Miss Cavell, an English woman, directress of a large
nursing home at Brussels, was quietly arrested by the German authorities
and confined in the prison of St. Gilles on the charge that she had
aided stragglers from the Allied Armies to escape across the frontier
from Belgium to Holland, furnishing them with money, clothing and
information concerning the route to be followed.</p>

<hr />

<p>We reminded him (Baron Von der Lancken) of the burning of Louvain and
the sinking of the <span class="italic">Lusitania</span>, and told him that this murder would stir
all civilized countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in
at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss
Cavell shot than have harm come to one of the humblest German soldiers,
and his only regret was that they had not "three or four English old
women to shoot."</p>

<hr />

<p>The day brought forth another loathsome fact in connection with the
case. It seems the sentence of Miss Cavell was not pronounced in open
court. Her executioners, apparently in hope of concealing their
intentions from us, went into her cell and there behind locked doors
pronounced sentence upon her. It is all a piece with the other things
they have done.</p>

<p>On August 26, 1915, Squadron-Commander A. W. Bigsworth destroyed
single-handed, a German submarine by bombs from his aeroplane off Ostend
on the coast of Belgium.</p>

<p>The British Admiralty said in reference to this episode:</p>

<p>"It is not the practice of the Admiralty to publish statements regarding
the losses of German submarines, important though they have been, in
cases where the enemy have no other sources of information as to the
time and place at which these losses have occurred. In the case referred
to above, however, the brilliant feat of Squadron-Commander Bigsworth
was performed in the immediate neighbourhood of the coast in occupation
of the enemy, and the position of the sunken submarine has been located
by a German destroyer."</p>

<p>When, on Sept. 21, after the Bulgarian mobilization had begun, M.
Venizelos, who was then Prime Minister of Greece, asked France and
ourselves for 150,000 men, it was on the express understanding that
Greece would mobilize also. Greece did, in fact, mobilize under his
direction on Sept. 24, but it was not until Oct. 2 that M. Venizelos
found himself able to agree to the landing of British and French troops
under the formal protest, a merely formal protest, which he had already
made to the French Government. On Oct. 4&mdash;I wish these dates to be borne
in mind&mdash;M. Venizelos announced what had happened to the Greek Chamber,
and at the same time declared that Greece must abide by her treaty with
Serbia. The next day the King repudiated the declaration and then M.
Venizelos resigned. The new Government which succeeded declined to
recognize that a casus foederis had arisen between Greece and Serbia, in
spite of our constant insistence that Greece should make common cause
with Serbia, and the new Greek Government, while declaring their desire
to remain on friendly terms with the Allies, declined to depart from
their attitude of neutrality.</p>

<p>Neutral countries whose frontiers march with those of Germany have
rendered enormous aid to the Central Powers by the supply of materials
and food. The general practice of evasion has been to smuggle home
produce of all sorts for which high prices were forthcoming and use for
local consumption similar products imported from other countries over
seas. The imports of many lines of merchandise into Holland alone are
known to have increased from fifty to one hundred per cent. compared
with pre-war figures.</p>

<p>The last of the great Austro-German strokes had failed, and before the
beginning of October, 1915, the line of the enemy in the east was
established precisely where it was to be found unchanged until the great
offensive delivered upon its southern part by the Russians in the
beginning of June, 1916. Lord Kitchener put the matter simply and in
words the accuracy of which could be gauged by the exasperation they
caused at Berlin, when he said that the enemy had now in the East "shot
his bolt." It was a phrase exactly true. The expense in men, the
difficulty of bringing up munitionment; the entry into territories with
worse roads and less opportunities of supply; the fact that the line now
reached was cut by the great belt of marshes in the centre&mdash;all these
things between them brought the great adventure to a stand.</p>

fires started. Most of the victims were ordinary working folk, doing

messenger boy was killed when delivering a message, a potman died at his
work, a caterer was killed while returning from a Masonic lodge, a

<p>These atrocities had as their deliberate object the extermination of the
Armenian race, and it is not difficult to assess the guilt. The guilt
lay with the Young Turkish Government at Constantinople and with the
local officials who acted in collusion with them. But there was a
greater criminal even than the Young Turkish Government, for behind
Turkey stood the country that was Turkey&#39;s ally and the dominant partner
in the policy she pursued. There was a considerable variation in the
conduct of individual Germans in Turkey. The German missionaries seem to
have stood laudably by their principles, and the German Vice-Consul at
Erzerum is said to have sent the exiles relief. But in the Aleppo
province and Cilicia the German officials, both military and civil,
threw themselves actively into the Young Turks&#39; scheme; at Moush and Van
German officers are believed to have participated directly in the
slaughter, and at Erzerum they are reported to have taken their share of
the Armenian girls.</p>

<p>The Venizelist "Patris" took another view of the situation on the same
date:</p>

<p>Only those who are unable to foresee things, or who are panic-stricken,
would be unable to foretell the evolution of the events immediately
following the Austro-German attack on Serbia. The Central Empires, not
disposing enough troops for this campaign, needed the Bulgars, with whom
they associated; but they also needed the neutrality of Greece, because
without it Bulgaria would be unable to cooperate with them, as she would
have to defend herself against Greece. In order to secure Bulgar help,
the Austro-Germans used the method of compensation. The whole of Serbian
Macedonia, a part of Old Serbia, an exit on the Adriatic Sea,
concessions at the expense of Turkey&mdash;all this was a part of the
national problem of the Bulgarian lust of conquest. It was in this way
that the Bulgarians undertook the assassin&#39;s job of striking Serbia from
behind. In order to secure the neutrality of Greece, the Austro-Germans
resorted to the Prussian method of terrorism, inasmuch as no other
concessions and compensations were at hand. Both methods have been
equally successful.</p>

<p>It is well known that France granted loans to Russia only under the
condition that it develop its Polish fortresses and railroads against
us; also that England and France regarded Belgium as their route of
advance against us. We must protect ourselves politically and militarily
against this, and also insure our economic development.</p>

<p>As I said on Aug. 19, we are not the ones who are threatening the small
nations. We are battling in this struggle, forced upon us, not to
subjugate foreign nations, but to protect our life and freedom. This war
remains for the German Government what it was in the beginning and what
has been maintained in every pronunciamento&mdash;a defensive war of the
German Nation for its future.</p>

<p>The enemy were completely deceived. On the afternoon of December 20,
1915, a vigorous attack was begun in the Cape Helles area against some
trenches at the head of the Krithia ravine. With the help of fire from
warships, the trenches were taken with small loss, and held against
counter-attacks delivered that night. This operation helped to divert
the enemy&#39;s attention. At 3.30 <span class="smcap">A. M</span>. on the morning of December 21 a
huge mine was exploded by the Anzacs near Russell&#39;s Top. The Turks
thought the Anzacs were about to attack, and for forty minutes they
blazed away furiously with their rifles at the empty trenches. The
Australians left many letters of farewell to the Turks, assuring them
that they were clean fighters and that the Australians hoped to meet
them again.</p>

nature of the Turkish situation in the Caucasus seems to have been

advance of the victorious Russians who were shortly afterwards to
capture the great fortress of Erzerum with its entire garrison, guns and

<hr />

<p>On September 9, 1914, Joseph Walker enlisted for the duration of the
war; on January 11, 1916, the sea bore his dead body to the dyke at West
Capelle. This afternoon, at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, while the northwest wind whistled
over Walcheren, the English soldier was buried in the churchyard of West
Capelle.</p>

<p>First the vice-consul in the name of England spread the British flag
over him who for England had sacrificed his young life. Four men of West
Capelle carried the coffin outside and placed it at the foot of the
tower, that old gray giant, which has witnessed so much world&#39;s woe,
here opposite the sea. It was a simple, but touching ceremony.</p>

<p>"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live.... He cometh
forth like a flower and is cut down." Thus spoke the voice of the
minister and the wind carried his words, and the wind played with the
flag of England, the flag that flies over all seas, in Flanders, in
France, in the Balkans, in Egypt, as the symbol of threatened
freedom&mdash;the flag whose folds here covered a fallen warrior.</p>

<p>And in the roaring storm we went our way. There was he carried, the
soldier come to rest, and the flag fluttered in the wind and wrapped
itself round that son of England. Then the coffin sank into the ground
and the hearts of us, the departing witnesses, were sore. Earth fell on
it, and the preacher said: "Earth to earth, dust to dust."</p>

<p>On February 1, 1916, the small fishing trawler <span class="italic">King Stephen</span> from
Grimsby found the German Zeppelin L 19 floating in the North Sea with
her crew clinging to her. The captain of the trawler refused to take the
crew of the Zeppelin on board his boat, fearing he would be overpowered
and captured. His action caused a great outcry in Germany,
notwithstanding the fact that the Zeppelin was doubtless responsible for
the death of many women and children in England and had actually dropped
a bomb on a steamer during the previous night and left the crew to
perish.</p>

<p>The assault on the forts (Erzerum) and the principal position lasted
from February 11 till February 15 inclusive. After we had taken the
forts on the left flank of the principal Turkish line of defense,
extending about 27 miles, the fate of the forts in the centre and on the
right flank, and, after them, of the second line forts and the principal
defensive position, was decided on February 16 after short attacks.
These fortifications, which were full of Turkish dead, remained in our
possession.</p>

<p>During the assault on the fortress several Turkish regiments were
annihilated or made prisoners with all their officers. On the line of
forts alone we took 197 pieces of artillery of various calibres in good
condition. In the defence works of the central fortress we took another
126 pieces of artillery. In the fortified region of Erzerum we took a
large number of dep&ocirc;ts of various kinds, which have already been
mentioned by the Headquarter Staff. The exact number of Turkish
prisoners is 235 officers and 12,753 men.</p>

<p>About the time Turkey became involved in the war a telegram was
published as having been sent from Kaiser Wilhelm to the Crown Prince
announcing with evident satisfaction that the supreme Moslem authorities
at Constantinople had given their sanction to the declaration of a Holy
War against Russia, England, and France "as oppressors of the Moslems."
At one time it looked as though the aspirations implied by this message
might be carried out. There was a mutiny at Singapore in which Moslem
troops were implicated; there were outbreaks in the Italian Tripolitana
and among the Senoussi tribesmen on the western border of Egypt; there
was at least a threat against the Suez Canal, from the direction of
Beersheba, and there was, or seemed to be, the possibility of a
pro-German uprising in Persia. The advance of the Russians from the
Caspian has dissipated this last possibility; the Suez Canal is no
longer even threatened; the Senoussi have given their submission.
Finally, from India, from Sultan Mohammed Aga Khan, who is the spiritual
head of the many million Moslems in India, comes a declaration which
shows that the hopes of a holy war, as it seems to have been expected in
Germany, were never anything more than a myth.</p>

<p>We have seen that corps were specially called back to the interior of
Germany for reposing, training and even feeding calculated towards the
end in view. Light railways were built upon every side. Heavy artillery
was concentrated to the number of over one thousand pieces&mdash;all that
could be spared&mdash;and slowly massed in the woods by Spincourt, and an
immense head of shell accumulated during the four winter months. The
unfit were thoroughly combed out and every possible man taken to swell
the German effectives. Class 1916 after some four months&#39; training was
sent forward to the local depots behind the front with the object of
throwing it into the fighting the moment the losses should become
serious. Class 1917 began to be called out (in the month of December).
On the 19th of February, 1916, the first shots of the intensive
bombardment against the Verdun sector were fired, and on Monday the 21st
of February the great German offensive was launched.</p>

<p>Of the German Corps known to have been engaged the 3rd and 18th Corps
have been entirely used up, or "spent," as the military phrase goes. The
7th Reserve Corps has lost half, and the 15th Corps three-quarters, of
its available strengths. The German forces had by the evening of March 3
"used up," in addition to those already mentioned, a part of the 113th
Division, the 5th Reserve Corps, and the Bavarian Ersatz Division,
without taking into account the losses of other reinforcements, whose
presence on the battlefield has not yet been definitely ascertained.</p>

<p>None of the prisoners questioned estimated the losses suffered by their
companies at less than one-third of the total effectives. Taking into
account all available indications, it may safely be assumed that, during
the fighting of the last 13 days, the Germans have lost in killed,
wounded, and prisoners at least 100,000 men.</p>

telegraphed at great expense from Berlin, and supplied free copies of

English, who were constantly accused of having designs on the integrity
of Holland and of desiring to take possession of the Scheldt. This was
carried so far that a panic was created on March 31, 1916, by the report
of landing of the Entente forces in Zeeland. The report, which was
without any foundation, was circulated by the Germans and spread like
wild fire around the country.</p>

<p>We figure that the attempt to rush this important position (their object
was to capture Le Mort Homme, in order to render untenable the key
sector of Pepper Hill and Douaumont) cost the Germans fully 30,000 men,
of whom an unusually high proportion were killed, owing to their
inability to succor and save the slightly wounded.</p>

<p>Perhaps now the enemy will realize that he has reached a stalemate, for
the abrupt breakdown of yesterday&#39;s attempt against Vaux and Douaumont
proves once more it is impossible to advance there while we hold Le Mort
Homme, and the latter must seem to be impregnable.</p>

<p>Soldiers of the Army of Verdun! For three weeks you have been exposed to
the most formidable assaults yet attempted against us by the enemy.
Germany counted upon the success of this effort, which she believed to
be irresistible, and to which she has devoted her best troops and her
most powerful artillery. She hoped that the capture of Verdun would
revive the courage of her allies and would convince neutral countries of
German superiority. She had reckoned without you. Night and day, despite
a bombardment without precedent, you have resisted all attacks and
maintained our positions. The struggle is not yet at an end, for the
Germans require a victory. You will succeed in wresting it from them. We
have munitions and reserves in abundance; but, above all, you have
indomitable courage and faith in the destinies of the Republic. The eyes
of the country are upon you. You will be among those of whom it will be
said: they barred the road to Verdun to the Germans.</p>

<p>The British Official Press Bureau reports the German casualties during
February, 1916, at 35,198, of whom 10,211 were killed or died either of
wounds or sickness; 2,017 missing, 5,217 severely wounded, 1,340
prisoners, 11,865 slightly wounded. The German casualties during March,
including the slaughter at Verdun and the sanguinary struggles in the
eastern theatre, are estimated at 175,000. This estimate, added to the
previous reports, swell the German losses since the beginning of the
war&mdash;including all German nationalities: Prussians, Bavarians, Saxons,
and W&uuml;rttembergers, but excluding naval and colonial casualties&mdash;to the
grand total of 2,842,372, of which number about 660,000 were killed and
died of wounds, 40,000 died of sickness, 120,000 are prisoners, 220,000
are missing, 365,000 are severely wounded, 265,000 wounded, about
1,050,000 slightly wounded, 140,000 wounded remaining with units. The
number killed in action, estimating one-half the missing as killed, is
over 25 per cent. of the total.</p>

Mourning, desolation, and irremediable misery! No triumph, no victory
can atone for such a deluge of blood and tears! That capricious
Personage "somewhere in Heaven," whom Wilhelm calls "Unser Gott," may
possibly resent the deliberate casting away of golden opportunities on

<p>In short, with ever-ebbing vigor, the German Army is smashing its head

but the suicidal mania continues. Two months have passed since the early
success of the German attack ended with the capture of Vaux village.
Each resumption of the attempt to take Verdun since that time has been a
cause for increasing wonder. What is there about this enterprise that
has turned it into a fatal obsession, from which the German high command
cannot escape, however great the cost of continuance?</p>

<hr />

<p>On April 24 Sir Roger Casement, a former Consul General, was captured in
the act of trying to land German arms on the west coast of Ireland. He
had been conveyed thither in a German submarine, with two Irish soldiers
from German prisons. A German auxiliary cruiser loaded with 20,000
rifles and ammunition was taken and sunk at the same time. The vessel
was sunk by its own men, and the twenty-two German bluejackets on board
were made prisoners....</p>

<p>Casement had last been heard of in Germany, where he had attempted to
induce Irish prisoners of war to join an anti-British expedition to
Ireland. Testimony at his preliminary trial in London subsequently
showed that on Good Friday he had landed near Tralee from the German
submarine U-19 with a soldier named Bailey and another named Monteith.
In "McKinna&#39;s Fort" he was seen to drop a paper containing a code and
the words: "Await further instructions. Have decided to stay. Further
ammunition and rifles are needed. Send another ship." The small
collapsible boat in which he and his companions had landed also helped
to betray them, and Casement and Bailey were arrested before they could
get away in the automobile which was waiting for them.</p>

conducting that warfare in accordance with what the Government of the

International Law and the universally recognized dictates of humanity,
the Government of the United States is at last forced to the conclusion
that there is but one course it can pursue and that unless the German
Imperial Government should now declare and effect the abandonment of its
present methods of warfare against passenger and freight-carrying
vessels, this Government can have no choice but to sever diplomatic

<p>In view of the circumstances the German Government frankly admits that
the assurance given to the American Government, in accordance with which
passenger vessels were not to be attacked without warning, has not been
adhered to in the present case. As was intimated by the undersigned in
the note of the 4th instant, the German Government does not hesitate to
draw from this resultant consequences. It therefore expresses to the
American Government its sincere regret regarding the deplorable incident
and declares its readiness to pay an adequate indemnity to the injured
American citizens. It also disapproved of the conduct of the commander,
who has been appropriately punished.</p>

<p>For more than two months the battle of Verdun has raged almost
ceaselessly day and night. It is conceded that Germany has concentrated
picked troops and heavy guns in quantities never before seen in war.
Yet, apart from the first withdrawal of General Petain&#39;s army from
outlying positions to definite lines of defense, the two months fighting
has not given the attacking forces a gain of two miles.</p>

<p>The Germans have come with floating mines in the open seas, threatening
belligerents and neutrals equally. They have come with the
undiscriminating and murderous Zeppelin, which does military damage only
by accident. They have come with the submarine, which destroys neutral
and belligerent ships and crews, in scorn alike of law and mercy. They
have come upon blameless nations with invasion, incendiarism, and
confiscation. They have come with poisonous gases and liquid fire. All
their scientific genius has been dedicated to wiping out human life.
They have forced these things into general use in the war.</p>

<p>The Prussian authorities apparently have but one idea of peace&mdash;an iron
peace imposed on other nations by German supremacy. They do not
understand that free men and free nations will rather die than submit to
that ambition, and that there can be no end to the war till that aim is
defeated and renounced.</p>

<p>When Germany challenged us nearly two years ago to uphold with our lives
the ideals by which we professed to live, we accepted the challenge, not
out of madness, nor for glory or for gain, but to make good those
professions. Since then the Allies and our empire have fought that they
may be free and all earth may be free from the intolerable domination of
German ideals. We did not foresee the size of the task when it opened.
We do not flinch from it now that the long months have schooled us to
full knowledge and have tempered us nationally and individually to meet
it. The nations within the empire have created, maintained, and
reinforced from their best the great armies they devote without question
to this issue. They have emerged, one by one, as powers clothed with
power through discipline and sacrifice, strong for good by their bitter
knowledge of the evil they are meeting, and wise in the unpurchasable
wisdom of actual achievement. Knowing as nations what it is we fight
for, realizing as men and women the resolve that has been added to us by
what each has endured, we go forward now under the proud banner of our
griefs and losses to greater effort, greater endurance, and, if need be,
heavier sacrifice, equal sponsors for the deliverance of mankind.</p>

the war and peace problems with one another in a practical manner, only
then will we be nearing peace.</p>

<p>The soul of the royal work for the discovery of the missing is Don

to his Majesty. It is in the offices of his Secretariat, in the Palacio
Real, that this work is installed; it was soon so crowded there that it
became necessary to give up to it four halls, and then eight, in order
that the collaborators, becoming more and more numerous, might work
comfortably. In May, 1916, the work of the King, already a year old,
occupied at Madrid twenty-eight persons, who began their day at eight in
the morning and sometimes worked far into the night.</p>

<p>It is proved that from May 20 to May 25 (1916) seven different divisions
were flung into the battle on both sides of the Meuse. Four of these
were brought from other points of the Western front&mdash;two from Flanders,
two from the Somme.</p>

<p>On the left bank alone four divisions were employed in the last week-end
fighting. Without a thought of the enormous losses caused by our curtain
fire and machine guns, the German Command threw them one after the other
into the boiling pot east and west of Mort Homme. On May 22 alone,
before the capture of Cumi&egrave;res village, which has now been retaken, the
enemy made no fewer than 16 attacks upon the front from the Avocourt
Wood to the Meuse. Over 50,000 men sought that day to climb the slopes
of Mort Homme and the plateau of Hill 304. The great charnel heap had
15,000 fresh corpses flung upon it without the French lines having
yielded.</p>

<p>Field Marshal Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener, the British Secretary of
State for War, perished with his staff off the West Orkney Islands on
June 5 by the sinking of the British cruiser <span class="italic">Hampshire</span>, which struck a
mine and went down fifteen minutes later. "O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory?" Formerly they had sounded in our ears as
chords of solemn music, breathing consolation; now that we see them
clearly to be triumphant verities, living and everlasting truths, they
ring out like a trumpet call, summoning and inspiring the living to
stronger action. The work continues though the hand that moulded it
perishes; the body dies, but the soul lives on. There is no sting in the
grave when on either side men press forward to one immortal goal and
when living and dead battle together for incorruptible principles.
Whether individually we live or die signifies nothing, if that high
cause for which we fight wins. Lord Kitchener&#39;s death will not interfere
with the work he had undertaken, nor shall his passing delay, but rather
shall it hasten the victory to which he looked forward.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Crown Prince, after the gigantic effort of his armies, was
confronted with problems more vast, with a resistance more confident and
more efficient, than those which he had had to face in the opening days
of the Verdun offensive. In three days the French had been driven off
their first positions along a large portion of the Verdun front; over a
month later they were still defending with increasing vigour their
second line. Behind that line lay yet another, and the prospect of the
fall of Verdun was but faint upon the German horizon. The French could
already count upon victory, the price of Verdun having already been
exacted in the enemy&#39;s blood, without the position having been captured.
That price, it was said, had been fixed by the Imperial General Staff at
200,000 casualties.</p>

<p>Signor Baltisti, before the war, was Deputy for Trent in the Austrian

claims in the Trentino. When war broke out he joined a Trentino regiment
under the Italian flag.</p>

<p>He was captured by the Austrians in June, 1916, and executed, although
he wore an Italian uniform. His corpse was publicly hanged on a gibbet

<p>The Government has carried on the war in accordance with methods which
are even incompatible with everything which has been done hitherto&mdash;the
violation of Belgium and Luxemburg; the use of poison gases, which were

which killed both combatants and noncombatants, a submarine war on
commerce, the torpedoing of the <span class="italic">Lusitania</span>, etc.; pillage and extortion
of tribute, beginning with Belgium; the internment and imprisonment of
the population of the eastern provinces; various devices for forcing
prisoners to work against their own country, by spying for the Central
Powers, thereby committing an act of high treason; contracts arranged
between Zimmermann and Sir Roger Casement in December, 1915, for the
formation of armed units of English prisoners of war, for the purpose of
forming the Irish brigade. Besides these, other attempts must be
mentioned, which were made among the foreigners in concentration camps
in Germany, threatening them with internment unless they betrayed their
own countries and placed themselves at Germany&#39;s disposal.</p>

dividing the allied countries. No one among us will fall into such a

our troops with so much self-sacrifice are giving up their lives, the
word "peace" is a sacrilege if it means that the aggressor will not be
punished and if tomorrow Europe runs the risk of again being delivered
up to the despotism, fantasy, and caprice of a military caste athirst
for pride and domination. It would be the dishonor of the Allies! What
should our reply be if tomorrow, after having concluded such a peace,

missed the opportunity which is offered us of establishing on solid

<h3>RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE, JUNE, 1916</h3>

<p>The blow which the Russians have delivered to the Teutons has been one
of the hardest given to any belligerent during the entire war. Not even
the great German drive of last year has had the effect of the Russian
offense of the past six weeks. In this case it is much more than a loss
of territory; it is almost the destruction of an army. Russia had vast
reserves on which to fall back.</p>

<p>Austria apparently has none. Austria alone of all the belligerents is
practically exhausted. Only a week ago the Austrian Department of War
endeavored to get the consent of the Government to call into the
military service all men between the ages of 56 and 60. Nothing could
show more eloquently the very dire straits into which the Austrian Army
has fallen.</p>

<p>The Petrograd official <span class="italic">communiqu&eacute;</span> of June 27, 1916, stated that the
prisoners and trophies captured by the armies of General Brusiloff
between June 4-23 amounted to 4,031 officers, 194,041 men, 219 guns,
besides 644 machine-guns, 196 bomb mortars, 146 artillery ammunition
wagons and 38 searchlights.</p>

<p>The enormous importance of the Russian victories of June, 1916, as a
step in the attrition of the enemy forces was patent; the losses
suffered by the enemy on the Eastern front during those three weeks were
about equal to those he had suffered at Verdun in 130 days of fighting.</p>

sinking merchant vessels without warning and without regard for the
lives of passengers or crew, took a step which appeared to afford the
only chance of saving not only his vessel, but the lives of all on
board, can have been deliberately shot in cold blood for this action.</p>

<p>The German view of the situation at the end of June was well shown in a
typical article by the military correspondent of the "Berliner
Tageblatt," Major Moraht, actually published on July 1.</p>

<p>The writer began by declaring that "all the belligerent armies were now
at a critical stage." The Allies had undoubtedly increased the energy
and the uniformity of their conduct of war, and their great resources in
money and men and their command of the sea would enable them to do
everything possible "to hamper Germany&#39;s final victory."</p>

<p>The British offensive was about to begin, and "without a serious
settlement of accounts with England on the battlefields in the west the
Germans would not come a step nearer to peace." Major Moraht and the
other German writers betrayed no sense of the immensity of the coming
events, and it was clear that the Germans had not begun to dream of the
defeats that were about to be inflicted upon them.</p>

<p>The great armies recruited and trained by Lord Kitchener, with the
mountains of munitions piled up by Lloyd George, have become a
tremendous weapon in the skilled hands of General Sir Douglas Haig; and
they are supported on the right by a French army under General Foch that
has shown itself more than able to keep pace with them. It must not be
forgotten that the battle of the Somme is a joint enterprise of close
teamwork under the supreme direction of General Joffre.</p>

<p>Thus far we have heard less of the French than of the English wing, but
its achievement has been equally brilliant. The Germans caught between
these Frenchmen and Peronne, like those caught between the British and
Bapaume, have resisted to the limit of human endurance, but nothing
human could survive the awful blasting of high explosives to which their
first and second trench lines were subjected; and the Allies now have
the shells and the men to keep up the pressure indefinitely.</p>

Ovillers-la-Boiselle, Longueval, Podi&egrave;res. The French advanced on a
front of 10&frac12; miles and captured the German positions from Estr&eacute;es to
Vermando-Villers. On the Eastern Front, the Russians crossed the
Carpathians in the south and pierced Hindenburg&#39;s Riga line at several
points.</p>

<p>On the Isonzo the Italians began a great drive towards Gorizia.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
